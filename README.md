# 🏰 N-Queens Visualizer

Welcome to the **N-Queens Visualizer**! This project demonstrates the backtracking algorithm used to solve the N-Queens problem in real-time. The visualizer is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

## 📝 Algo Description

The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. This visualizer shows how the backtracking algorithm solves this problem step-by-step.

### Working

1. **Initialization**: The visualizer sets up an N×N chessboard.
2. **Backtracking Algorithm**: The core of the solution involves a recursive backtracking algorithm that attempts to place a queen in each row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.
3. **Real-Time Visualization**: As the algorithm proceeds, the visualizer updates the board in real-time, showing each move and backtrack.
4. **Logs**: Detailed logs display the moves and decisions made by the algorithm, helping users understand the process.

### Concept Used

- **Recursion**: The algorithm uses recursion to explore all possible placements of queens.
- **Backtracking**: If placing a queen leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different position.
